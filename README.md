=======
We would like to give a much clearer understanding of our baseball players by 
providing a direct visualization with data and graphs.

Our main goal is to see which variable is the best predictor of ERA by creating 
data visualizations for each with the different variables being on the x-axis, 
and the ERA being on the Y-axis. From these visualization, we will be able to 
see the correlation for each, which will tell us which is the best predictor for 
ERA.
