# Predicting ERA

This project is about seeing which baseball statistic (K%, BB%, WHIP, OBP) is 
the best predictor for a pitcher's ERA.

## Overview

Our main goal is to see which variable is the best predictor of ERA by creating 
data visualizations for each with the different variables being on the x-axis, 
and the ERA being on the Y-axis. From these visualization, we will be able to 
see the correlation for each, which will tell us which is the best predictor for 
ERA.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
