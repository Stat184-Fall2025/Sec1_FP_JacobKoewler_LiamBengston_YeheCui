# Predicting ERA

This project is about seeing which baseball statistic (K%, BB%, WHIP, OBP) is 
the best predictor for a pitcher's ERA.

The Project is based on the data of baseball statistics with information of different players.

## Overview

Our main goal is to see which variable is the best predictor of ERA by creating 
data visualizations for each with the different variables being on the x-axis, 
and the ERA being on the Y-axis. From these visualization, we will be able to 
see the correlation for each, which will tell us which is the best predictor for 
ERA.

We would like to give a much clearer understanding of our baseball players by providing a direct visualization with data and graphs.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

Be sure to list where you got any data used within the project. Be sure to acknowledge any one whose work or elements you're drawing upon.

We got the data from a website named Savant. It basically combined the players' information specifically for people to see.

## Current Plan

Provide some information about what you intend to doe with the project. You can additionally refer the visitor to your detailed plan document.

We intend to provide a deeper insight of baseball and a better understanding for the audiences.

## Repo Structure

Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.

The structure of our repo is mostly based rows and columns for the names of the players and their information.

## Authors

Give information about who are the authors of the project and how people can get in touch if they have questions.
